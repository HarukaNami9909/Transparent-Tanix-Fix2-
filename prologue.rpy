    "A long, long time ago…"
    "A circular land known as Cunabula rested above the luminous blue sky." 
    "There lived a goddess who protected this very nest, using her divine powers to nurture each and every landscape." 
    "She gave homes to phoenixes, birds that live in a never ending cycle of constant birth after death."
    "The goddess served her birds with protection, while the birds offered her entertainment such as dancing and playing music."
    "It was their own way to bless and honor themselves until one day..."
    "The goddess vanished without a trace. All of her birds went into a panic, pecking and blaming each other for her disappearance."
    "As time passed, they searched for their goddess, but to no avail."
    "Many of them have lost hope."
    "One by one, each bird bravely flew around the sky, further away from Cunabula to forget their superior who gave them protection."
    "They eventually pronounced her as ‘lost forever’. For phoenixes, there is no such thing as 'death'."
    "However..."
    "Only one remained loyal to both his home and his goddess."
    "He spent his time enduring pain from his loneliness by singing and dancing alone." 
    "Centuries had passed, and the bird wandered aimlessly around Cunabula, which once was a beautiful nest that was surrounded by eternal light." 
    "Without the goddess' magic, the leaves died quickly, even the ground grew unhealthy."
    "It left the nest with nothing but darkness…"
    "And yet, the bird still stayed… waiting for his goddess to come home…"

    "..............."
    "We all have a purpose in life."
    "We live for the forest's leaves that grow vividly."
    "We live for the light that shines upon the blue sky every day."
    "We must live…"
    "For 'their' sake…"
